# This repository contains all the CAD iteration files for this project

I have iterated through 3 vrsions of motor mounts, and I am happy with the current version of the motor mount. The parts are already printed, and I will assemble the rover shortly

## TODO:
- Create a ring for the motor for the encoder
- Create a motor mount with suspensions
- Create a wheel
