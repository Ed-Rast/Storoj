This is a personal robotics project. The goal of this project is to create a rover with different functions, and practice various techniques in Robotics. 
In particular, I would like to create a rover that could communicate with a central computer over long distances and be aware of its position relative to its initial position as well as be able to relocate to any point on the plane, communicated to it. 

``` The Project if not compliated, the progress will be uploaded weekly ```

This rover is part of the system which includes a rover, a drone, and a remote control center. Please see folder Maxim for information regarding the drone.
