# Greetings

While this file will probably not contain any tecjnical information, I would like to keep a record of the process of creating this project.
Zahar is my attempt to create a version of rover while learning and practicing various robotics, embeded, software, and other teckniques.

At this point, I have created a rough outline of the project with the form of the rover and the functions I want it to have. I have iterated the design of the motor mounts 3 times now, and I already have all 4 of the motor mounts printed. 
Earlier this week I have soldered all the connectors on the ESCs, the battery, and I have created a power distribution connector, that works, but is literally 3 p9ieces of wire connected in parralel and in series to distribut 11.7V from my battery to the 5.5V ESCs. 
I dont like this solution with power, and I am already working on the proper power distribution PCB. 
In addition, I have tested all the motors with Arduibno, and they work fine. 

Now, I am downloading and practicing with Docker and Nucleo board to create a first iteration of the program. 
The project is still in extrimely early stages, but I will already assemble the rover soon, and will have the program to move it.

On friday, I have assembled the rover. Seing it for the first time was truly a great feeling of accomplishment. In addtion to assembling it, I wrote a quick ptobram for Arduino Uno to run all of the motors. I would like to compile a video about the build and attach it to this log. 
While it is satidfying to see my design come to life, I realised that I failed complitely. First, the motors I do not have enough torque to start the movment. Second, the motor position does not allow the rover to move, and, the most irritating thing, is that the power from the battery, while succesfully powering the ESCs, cannot properly power the cotroller. 
Taking into account all this, I would like to complitely rebuild the rover, making a proper research and design analysis before starting manufacturing and software production. 
Thus, the project Zahar will take a lot more time to compliate, and the manufacturing itself will not even start soon. However, I will create a research folder and update CAD folder, as well as updating the Dev Log to show the work I put into the project.
